## Folder Structure

* `components`: this folder will hold all of our React components (both container and presentational).
* `services`: allows you to connect to APIs (using axios to call the HN API) or provide extended functionality to the application (Markdown support)
* `store`: holds all of our logic for Redux and managing state.
* `styles`: declare variables, templates, and resusable style patterns that can be shared among components.
* `utils`: Helper functions that can be reused throughout the application.
